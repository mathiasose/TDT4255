\chapter{Conclusion}
The requirements for the implementation were fulfilled.
The new implementation has a pipelined design, improving the processor throughput,
but avoids the pitfalls that pipeline hazards create.
The test program from exercise 1 outputs correct results both in the testbench simulation and on an \gls{fpga}.

The unit tests from the previous exercise still pass, some of them with some modifications,
and new tests have been created and passed for the specific pipeline hazards.

The instructions from exercise 1 that were not part of the requirements are still supported in the new implementation.

The exercise had a good learning outcome.
The group members now have a much better understanding of the workings of a pipelined processor.
The group also began using more \gls{vhdl} features such as records, functions and generics that were not utilized in exercise 1.
