\chapter{Introduction}
This report presents a solution to exercise 2 of the TDT4255 course at NTNU.
The exercise builds on the solution from exercise 1 \cite{bib:ex1-report},
a VHDL implementation of a multi-cycle processor capable of executing a subset of the MIPS instruction set.
In this exercise, the multi-cycle aspect is removed,
and instead a pipelined design is implemented.
