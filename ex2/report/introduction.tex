\chapter{Introduction}
This report presents a solution to exercise 2 of the TDT4255 course at NTNU.
The exercise builds on the solution from exercise 1 \cite{bib:ex1-report},
a VHDL implementation of a multi-cycle processor capable of executing a subset of the MIPS instruction set.
In this exercise, the multi-cycle aspect is removed,
and instead a pipelined design is implemented.

In addition to our own code from exercise 1,
exercise 2 also builds on what was provided with exercise 1.
This includes a \textit{MIPSSystem} \gls{vhdl} module that the processor is a submodule in,
which connects the processor to data and instruction memories and facilitates system testing in a provided testbench.
