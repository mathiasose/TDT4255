\section{Further Work}
There is a lot to be gained from improving loop performance.
By implementing branch prediction the number of pipeline flushes could be reduced.

In order to improve on the load word stalls,
a dynamic scheduling scheme could be implemented,
rearranging instructions to cover up the required stalling cycle.

It would also be possible to have more than one instruction executed each cycle
by implementing multiple functional units.
This requires extra hardware and increases complexity.

Perhaps most crucially the current implementation lacks exception mechanisms.
Implementing this would be very much required if the processor were to be used in any kind of real-life scenario.
