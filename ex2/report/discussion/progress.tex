\section{Progress}
The group gained valuable experience about VHDL and the \textit{XILINX} toolchain from exercise 1.
In this exercise the coding and testing went along smoothly.
We started using a few new tools, such as records and generics.
The main thing that had to be learned in order to complete the exercise
was the theory of a pipelined processor.
During development the textbook and lecture slides were used to gain a better understanding about pipelining,
and the corresponding hazard detection and correction methods.
