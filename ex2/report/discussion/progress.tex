\section{Progress}
The group gained valuable experience about VHDL and the \textit{XILINX} toolchain from exercise 1.
In this exercise the coding and testing went along smoothly.
We started using a few new tools, such as records and generics.

The main obstacle for the exercise was learning the theory of a pipelined processor.
The textbook and lecture slides were used to gain a better understanding of this,
to a much larger degree than in exercise 1.
