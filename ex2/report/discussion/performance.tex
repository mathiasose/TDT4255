\section{Performance}
With a pipelined design,
the processor achieves a higher max frequency compared to the multi-cycle design.
The processor is also able to execute one instruction per clock cycle most of the time.
These improvements together means a major performance improvement over the multi-cycle processor design.

The exceptions to the one instruction per clock cycle rule are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Load word} instructions with an immediately following data dependent instruction,
        which requires the system to stall for one cycle.
    \item \textit{Jump} or taken \textit{branch} instructions,
        where the processor has to flush three stages.
\end{itemize}
