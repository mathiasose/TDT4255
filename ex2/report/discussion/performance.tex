\section{Performance}
With a pipelined design,
the processor achieves a slightly higher max frequency compared to the multi-cycle design.
Even though the max frequency has not increased considerably,
the number of instructions per cycle has increased greatly with the new design.
These improvements together means a noticeable performance improvement over the multi-cycle processor design.

The group does not have enough experience with the synthesis report from \textit{Xilinx ISE} to determine were the design could have been optimized.
Given more time, increasing clock frequency would have been prioritized.

The processor is able to execute one instruction per clock cycle most of the time.
The exceptions to the one instruction per clock cycle rule are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Load word} instructions with an immediately following data dependent instruction,
        which requires the system to stall for one cycle.
    \item \textit{Jump} or taken \textit{branch} instructions,
        where the processor has to flush three stages.
\end{itemize}
