\section{Performance}
With a pipelined design, the processor achieves a higher max frequency compared to the multi-cycle design.
The processor is able to execute one instruction per clock cycle most of the time,
the execptions being:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Load word} instructions with an immediately following data dependent instruction,
        which requires the system to stall for one cycle.
    \item \textit{Jump} or taken \textit{branch} instructions,
        where the processor has to flush three stages.
\end{itemize}
