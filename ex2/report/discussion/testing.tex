\section{Test Coverage}
A pipelined processor introduces new hazards in the design as mentioned earlier.
During development testbenches for each hazard were created to make sure they were properly handled.
Each testbench requires a specific method to handle a specific hazard.

The provided testbench contains multiple hazards and tests that the different hazard mitigation methods work together.
%Towards the end of development all the given tests passed, but the results on the FPGA was wrong.
%We discovered that the system test didn't cover all the hazard cases.

For better test coverage we could have created more programs for system testing,
to test the interaction between more instructions, hazards and hazard mitigations methods.
