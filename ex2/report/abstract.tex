\chapter*{Abstract}
In this exercise the group builds on the VHDL MIPS processor from exercise 1,
removing the multi-cycle aspect and instead implementing pipelining.
In order to mitigate hazards, data-forwarding, stalling and pipeline flushing is implemented.
As before, the design is validated both with simulated testbenches and physically on an FPGA.
