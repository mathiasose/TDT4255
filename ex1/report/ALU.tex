\section{Arithmetic Logic Unit}
The \gls{alu} takes two 32 bit operands.
Opcodes is recieved from the control module and the \gls{alu} performs operation based on the opcode.

\gls{alu} has a status signal attached to the \gls{pc} module called \textit{alu\_zero}.
\textit{alu\_zero} is used by the \textit{BEQ} instruction and is set high when the \textit{SUB} opration returns 0.

After implementing the required \gls{alu} operations, it required litle effort to add additional functionality.
The \gls{alu} were extended with a few extra operations: NOR, XOR, SLL, SRL, SRA.
