\section{Adding More Instructions}
\label{sec:more_instructions}
After having sucessfully tested the minimum required instruction set on the FPGA,
we took another look at the full MIPS instruction set.

We looked up the binary values of instructions and functions online\cite{bib:opencores},
then implemented some of them.

\subsection{Arithmetic and Logical I-Type Instructions}
With an already functioning implementation containing various ALU operations and I-type insructions,
it was very simple to also implement the I-type versions of the existing arithmetic-logical operations, \texttt{ADDI}, \texttt{ANDI}, \texttt{ORI} and \texttt{SLTI} by setting the correct signals in the control module.
With \texttt{NOR} and \texttt{XOR} existing as operators in VHDL, these could be implemented as ALU operations just as simply as the existing ones,
which enabled the instructions \texttt{NOR}, \texttt{XOR} and \texttt{XORI}

\subsection{Shift Instructions}
In order to implement the shift instructions \texttt{SLL}, \texttt{SRL},
the ALU needed access to the part of the instruction that contains the number of positions to shift.
This signal was added and can be seen in figure \ref{fig:architecture}.
With that connection it was again a very simple task to add the shift functionality to the ALU, since VHDL provides functions for this.
Listing \ref{lst:shift} shows the syntax for this.

\noindent{
    \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=VHDL, label=lst:shift, caption=Shifting a vector in VHDL]
r <= operand_t(shift_left(unsigned(vec), to_integer(unsigned(shamt))));
r <= operand_t(shift_right(unsigned(vec), to_integer(unsigned(shamt))));
r <= operand_t(shift_right(signed(vec), to_integer(unsigned(shamt))));
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{minipage}
}
