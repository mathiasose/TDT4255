\chapter{Conclusion}
The requirements for implemented instructions were fulfilled.
All tests in the provided testbench were successful,
and the \gls{mips} program from the testbench was tested on the \gls{fpga} with the \textit{hostcomm} tool,
where it produced the same output as on the testbench.

Additional instructions beyond the minimum requirement were also implemented and verified with testbenches to some extent.

The exercise was a very good learning experience.
The group members went from a very limited understanding of \gls{vhdl} and processor design,
to being able to find and reason about errors and easily implement more features in the existing design.
\textit{Isim} was especially useful as soon as we understood how to utilize it during debugging.
