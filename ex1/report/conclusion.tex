\chapter{Conclusion}
The requirements for implemented instructions were fulfilled.
All tests in the provided testbench were succesfull,
and the MIPS program from the testbench was tested on the FPGA with the HostComm tool,
where it produced the same output.

Additional instructions beyond the minimum requirement were also implemented and verified with testbenches.

The exercise was a very good learning experience.
The group members went from a very limited understanding of VHDL and processor design,
to being able to find and reason about errors and easily implement more features in the existing design.
