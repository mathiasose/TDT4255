\chapter{Introduction}
In this exercise we were given the task to implement a simplified version of a multi cycle MIPS processor.
The implementation is written in VHDL and simulated in XILINX ISE.
After implementing the MIPS processor, the design is tested and verified on a XILINX Spartan-6 FPGA.

\section{MIPS Processor}
A MIPS processor uses a RISC instruction set and a load store architecture.
All the instructions are 32 bit.
There are three different instruction types: R-type, I-type and J-type.

\section{Approach}
The main components in our solution is \gls{pc}, \gls{alu}, transform and a registers module.
An overview of the architecture can be seen in figer \ref{fig:architecture}.
As this exercise is quite exstensive, the problem is divided into several compontens.
Each compontents has a corresponding testbench to verify that the implementation works according to the specification.
