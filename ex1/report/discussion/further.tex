\section{Further}
If we had more time we could take a closer look at optimizing.
Possible optimizations include hardware utilization, clock frequency and energy efficiency.

Test coverage could definently be improved.
The "extra" instructions that were added last are not covered by the main testbench program.
We have added some tests, for example for the new ALU operations,
but had to prioritize report writing rather than extensive testing.

In the next exercise the implementation will be modified to use a pipelined architecture,
which should improve the clock frequency significantly.
