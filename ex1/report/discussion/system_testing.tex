\section{System Testing}
After implementing each component separately, the system was tested as a whole.
During this stage the system testbench showed unexpected behaviour.
Initially it was really hard to find where the error originated from,
but as we gained more experience with the simulator, errors became easier to trace.
Most of the errors were logical errors: wrong status signals, wrong MUX order and missing signals in sensitivity list.
