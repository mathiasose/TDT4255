\section{Progress}
There were no big technical innovations required,
the main obstacle that had to be overcome was to learn to use VHDL and the \textit{XILINX} tools.

The submodules were created first,
with testbenches based on our own assumptions.
This was relatively simple and seemingly worked well,
but as we were expecting,
when the modules were connected the main testbench revealed a lot of problems.
Many hours were spent inspecting the waveform simulations in \textit{ISim} and different changes were tested.
One by one the errors were identified and corrected,
and a working implementation eventually emerged.

At this point we had learned a lot and had an intimate understanding of our own implementation,
so adding more instructions at this point was a breeze.
