\section{Unit testing}
New features were mostly developed by first writing failing tests,
then implementing the features required to pass the tests.
Sometimes the test were later found to be flawed and had to be adapted.
Despite this it was very useful to have tests that could be run at any time to check that new functionality did not break old functionality.
