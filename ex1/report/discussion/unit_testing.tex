\section{Unit Testing}
New features were mostly developed by first writing failing tests,
then implementing the features required to pass the tests.
Sometimes the test were later found to be flawed and had to be adapted.
Despite this, having test was very useful, to be able to run at any time and check that new functionality did not break old functionality.
