\section{Performance}
The final implementation may achieve a maximum clock frequency of 46.430 MHz.
The processor only handles one instruction at any given time.
As a result it exectues one instruction each second or third cycle, depending on whether the instruction accesses the data memory or not.
The implemented processor may execute 23.215 million instructions in best case cenario, and 15.477 million instructions in worst case.

Implementing piplineing on the processor would increase number of instructions executed each second.
Pipelineing would make it possible to execute one instruction each clock cycle.
