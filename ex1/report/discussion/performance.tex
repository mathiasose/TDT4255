\section{Performance}
The final implementation may achieve a maximum clock frequency of 46.430 MHz.
The processor only handles one instruction at any given time.
As a result it exectues one instruction each second or third cycle, depending if the instruction accesses the data memory.
The implemented processor may execute at most 23.215 M and in worst case 15.477 M instructions each second.

Implementing piplineing on the processor would increase number of instructions executed each second.
Pipelineing would make it possible to execute one instruction each clock cycle.
