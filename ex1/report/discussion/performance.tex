\section{Performance}
The final implementation may achieve a maximum clock frequency of $46.430 MHz$ according to the synthesis report.
The processor is not pipelined and only handles one instruction at any given time,
for multiple cycles,
meaning it finished one instruction every second or third clock cycle,
depending on whether the instruction accesses the data memory or not.
The implemented processor may execute 23.215 million instructions per second in best case scenario, and 15.477 million in the worst case.
