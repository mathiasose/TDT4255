\section{"Load Immediate"}
The task description required the "LDI" instruction to be implemented.
There is a pseudo-instruction called "li" in the MIPS reference card \cite{bib:compendium},
but since it is a pseudo-instruction it is not within the scope of the processor implementation.
After asking for a clarification we decided that implementing the \texttt{LUI} instruction would suffice as the minimum requirement,
and by later adding other instructions like \texttt{ADDI} and \texttt{SLL} we made sure that a compiler could in fact translate the pseudo-instruction to some combination of supported instructions.
