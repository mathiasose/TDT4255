\section{"Load immediate"}
The task description required the "LDI" instruction to be implemented.
There is a pseudo-instruction called "li" in the MIPS reference card,
but since it is a pseudo-instruction it is not within the scope of the processor implementation.
After asking for a clarification we decided that implementing the LUI instruction would suffice as the minimum requirement,
and by later adding other instructions like ADDI and SLL we made sure that a compiler could in fact translate the pseudo-instruction to some combination of supported instructions.
