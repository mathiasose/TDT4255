\section{Development}
For these exercise the primary tools used were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   \textit{XILINX ISE} for writing and syntax checking VHDL
    \item   \textit{XILINX ISim} for testing modules in testbenches
    \item   \textit{hostcomm}\cite{bib:hostcomm} for testing the synthesized processor on an FPGA
    \item   \textit{git} for collaboration and version control
    \item   \textit{draw.io} for sketching components for the report
\end{itemize}
