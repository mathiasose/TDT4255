\section{Unit testing}
New features were mostly developed by first writing failing tests,
then implementing the features required to pass the tests.
Sometimes the test were later found to be flawed and had to be adapted.
Despite this it was very useful to have tests that could be run at any time to check that new functionality did not break old functionality.

\section{"Load immediate"}
The task description required the "LDI" instruction to be implemented.
There is a pseudo-instruction called "li" in the MIPS reference card,
but since it is a pseudo-instruction it is not within the scope of the processor implementation.
After asking for a clarification we decided that implementing the LUI instruction would suffice as the minimum requirement,
and by later adding other instructions like ADDI and SLL we made sure that a compiler could in fact translate the pseudo-instruction to some combination of supported instructions.
