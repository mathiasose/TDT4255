\chapter*{Abstract}

In this exercise the group created a \gls{vhdl} implementation of a multicycle processor capable of executing a subset of the \gls{mips} instruction set.
The processor was written such that it could integrate with other provided modules,
which facilitated testing on an \gls{fpga}.
The same program was tested first in a testbench simulation,
then on the \gls{fpga}.
After successfully implementing and testing the required subset of intructions,
some additional instructions were also added to the processor capabilitites.
