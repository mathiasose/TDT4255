\chapter*{Abstract}

In this exercise the group made a VHDL implementation of a processor capable of executing a subset of the MIPS instruction set.
The processor was written such that it could integrate with other provided modules,
which facilitated testing on an FPGA.
The same instructions were tested first in a testbench simulation,
then on the FPGA.
After successfully implementing and testing the required subset of intructions,
some additional instructions were also added to the processor capabilitites.
