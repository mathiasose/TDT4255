\section{Immediate Value Transform Submodule}

In the suggested architecture there was indicated that a module for sign extending a 16-bit vector to 32 bits.
This 16-bit vector comes from the immediate value part of I-type instructions.
At first we implemented this without a submodule,
since it only required a one-line function call in VHDL to extend the number.

As we made progress on the exercise, we realised that the \texttt{LUI} instruction required a module that could extend a 16-bit vector to 32 bits by left-shifting.
The natural solution to this was to create a new submodule which could take a 16 bit input and a 1 bit control signal, then output the appropriate extended vector.
Figure \ref{fig:imm_val_tf} shows this module.
