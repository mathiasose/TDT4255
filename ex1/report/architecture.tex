\section{Top Level Architecture}
A \gls{vhdl} project was provided for the exercise,
containing instruction and data memory implementations,
a \textit{MIPSProcessor} \gls{vhdl} module without a functioning implementation,
and a \textit{MIPSSystem} \gls{vhdl} module connecting the processor module to the memories.

The scope of the exercise was to create the \textit{MIPSProcessor} implementation.
An \gls{rtl} sketch of a suggested architecture was provided (see appendix \ref{app:suggested_architecture}).
The implementation described in this report is closely based on this suggested architecture.

Most of the functionality of the processor was implemented in appropriate submodules.
On the top level the processor only consists of signals connecting ports of different submodules,
and a few multiplexers for directing signals based on other signals.

An overview of the processor architecture can be seen in figure \ref{fig:architecture}.
