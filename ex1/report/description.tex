\chapter{Solution}

A VHDL project was provided for the exercise, containing instruction and data memories,
a MIPSProcessor VHDL file without a functioning behavioral,
and a MIPSSystem VHDL file connecting the processor module to the memories.

The scope of the exercise was to finish the MIPSProcessor implementation.
An RTL sketch of a suggested architecture was provided.
Our implementation is closely based on this suggested architecture.

Most of the functionality of the processor was implemented in appropriate submodules.
On the top level the processor only consists of signals connecting ports of different submodules,
and a few multiplexers for directing signals based on other signals.
