\section{Registers submodule}
Both R-type and I-type instructions read and write these registers.
Each register is 32 bit wide.
Register 0 is reserved, and should always contain the value 0.

Data can be written to a register by enabling \texttt{register\_write}.
The input value of \texttt{write\_data} will then be written to the register addressed by \texttt{write\_register}.

The two outputs of the module do not require enabling,
and will constantly output the value addressed by the corresponding address input.

The inputs and outputs of the module can be seen in figure \ref{fig:architecture}.
