\section{Registers submodule}
The register module contains an array of 32 general purpose register.
Each register is 32 bit wide.
Register 0 is reserved, and always contains the value 0.

When \texttt{register\_write} is set high in the control module, data is written to a register with the address from \texttt{write\_register}.

On each execute cycle data is fetched from two registers and sent to \texttt{read\_data\_1} and \texttt{read\_data\_2} outputs.
\texttt{read\_data\_1} and \texttt{read\_data\_2} is addressed through \texttt{read\_register\_1} and \texttt{read\_register\_2}.
