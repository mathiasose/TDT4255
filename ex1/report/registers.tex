\section{Registers submodule}
The register module contains an array of 32 general purpose register. Each register is 32 bit wide. Register 0 is reserved, and always contains the value 0.

When register{\_}write is set high in the control module, data is written to a register with the address from write{\_}register.

On each execute cycle data is fetched from two registers and sent to read{\_}data{\_}1 and read{\_}data{\_}2 outputs. read{\_}data{\_}1 and read{\_}data{\_}2 is addressed through read{\_}register{\_}1 and read{\_}register{\_}2.

% Maybe add italic to every register name?
